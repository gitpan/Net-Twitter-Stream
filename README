DESCRIPTION
    The Streaming verson of the Twitter API allows near-realtime access to
    various subsets of Twitter public statuses.

    Recent update: Track and follow are now merged into a single api call.
    /1/status/filter.json now allows a single connection go listen for
    keywords and follow a list of users.

    HTTP Basic authentication is supported (no OAuth yet) so you will need a
    twitter account to connect.

    JSON format is only supported. Twitter may depreciate XML.

    Options user, pass: required, twitter account user/password callback:
    required, a subroutine called on each received tweet
